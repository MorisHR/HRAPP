# Department Intelligence - Tenant Value Analysis
## What Do Customers Actually Want?

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Question:** "Are these features that tenants would want to see?"
**Analysis:** Business value from tenant perspective

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Short Answer:** YES, but prioritize differently based on TENANT VALUE, not technical coolness.

**Top 3 Features Tenants DESPERATELY Want:**
1. 💰 **Cost Optimization** - Direct ROI, saves money (HIGH DEMAND)
2. ⚠️ **Turnover Risk Analysis** - Retention costs 50-200% of salary (HIGH DEMAND)
3. ⚖️ **Workload Distribution** - Prevents burnout lawsuits (MEDIUM-HIGH DEMAND)

**Features Tenants Don't Care About (Yet):**
- Restructuring recommendations (too sensitive, political)
- Cross-department collaboration insights (nice-to-have, not urgent)
